Based on the Universal Pokemon Randomizer by Dabomstew

Special Fork to randomize BSTs created by Heraldere

# Info

This personal fork was initially created to test out ideas relating to randomizing Base Stat Totals
using the [Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx). 

It has since become a bit of a dumping ground for any idea I want to play around with
when it comes to randomized Pokemon games (usually in the context of [ironMON](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1) challenge runs).

## What features?

- Added an option for Random Base Stat Totals in the randomization settings
    - Base stat totals will be randomized on a Log-Normal curve, with parameters 
    varying depending on what settings are selected.
- Options relating to my [bootleg ironmon](https://pastebin.com/5ByxVbFF) ruleset
- Anything else I think of in the future

## Will these features make it to the main ZX fork?

Most of them are not a good fit for the Universal randomizer. I think a strong case can be made for
randomized BSTs, but I haven't formally broached the topic with the devs on the main fork.

For now, this is 

## Can you add [x specific feature]?
Maybe? I'm not exactly taking requests, but if you have a general feature that is the right combination of
easy / funny / fun, then I can try to be accommodating with a feature branch. 
Fair warning: it may take a while for me to get around to it.
