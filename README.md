Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX by Ajarmar

With significant contributions from darkeye, cleartonic

Based on the Universal Pokemon Randomizer by Dabomstew

# Purpose
The purpose of this fork was originally to fix minor issues, and to rebalance/change some things. As such, you might find that some of the things that are changed are not necessarily _better,_ but rather just different. Regardless, these changes have the goal of making the randomizer more fun to play, so hopefully you (the person reading this) find the changes to be good.

The fork has since then become a bit more ambitious, adding new features and support for new games. Additions/updates will still be done at my discretion, so don't contact me to tell me to add things to the randomizer. However, if you find something that seems to be a bug, feel free to submit an issue. Thanks!

Have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases) for changelogs.
